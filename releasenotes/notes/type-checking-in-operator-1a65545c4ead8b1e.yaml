    Operators and classes that combine stop strategies (namely ``&``, ``|``, ``stop_any`` and ``stop_all``) check that their operands are of type ``stop_base`` to avoid some weird constructions (see #211).
    Similarly, operators and classes that combine wait strategies (namely ``+`` and ``wait_combine``) check that their operands are of type ``wait_base``.
