    Added a new stop function: stop_before_delay, which will stop execution
    if the next sleep time would cause overall delay to exceed the specified delay. 
    Useful for use cases where you have some upper bound on retry times that you must
    not exceed, so returning before that timeout is preferable than returning after that timeout.
