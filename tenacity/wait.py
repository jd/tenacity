    Wait strategy based on the results of this Amazon Architecture Blog:

    https://www.awsarchitectureblog.com/2015/03/backoff.html

    The Full Jitter strategy attempts to prevent synchronous clusters
    from forming in distributed systems by combining exponential backoff
    with random jitter. This differs from other strategies as jitter isn't
    added to the exponentially increasing sleep time, rather the time is
    computed is uniformly random between zero and the exponential point.

    Excerpted from the above blog:
        sleep = random_between(0, min(cap, base * 2 ** attempt))

    A competing algorithm called "Decorrelated Jitter" is competitive
    and in some circumstances may be better. c.f. the above blog for
    details.

    Example:
        wait_full_jitter(0.5, 60) # initial window 0.5sec, max 60sec timeout

    Optional:
        base: (float) starting jitter window size in seconds.
            Equals 'base' above.
        max_timeout_sec: (float, default 60.0) Maximum time to wait.
            Equals 'cap' above.

    Returns: (float) time to sleep in seconds
